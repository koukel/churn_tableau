# Tableau Dashboard of Customer Churn

## Project Overview

This [project](https://public.tableau.com/views/TelecommunicationsChurnDashboard/CustomerStory?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) is based on a project from my graduate program and altered in order to add to my public portfolio.  This serves as an early example of my abilities as a reference to see how I have grown as a data scientist.  The data used in this dataset is available in this repository. 

In this project I have created a Tableau dashboard to display some key performance indicators in customer churn.  The Churn.pdf file shows the dashboard layout, while the Churn.twbx file is the packaged interactive workbook.  A detailed report discussing my process and considerations is given in the Tableau Dashboard and Storytelling Report document.
